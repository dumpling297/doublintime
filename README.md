# Dublin Time
  A JavaScript game played on a 4x4 grid, in which users combine tiles of like numbers to form a new tile of the sum of those numbers until they run out space

## MVP
  Create a working version of 2048 in JavaScript, features include moving and combining tiles for gameplay, score tracking, and smooth animation.

## Technologies
  My goal is to do this with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, not incorporating any exterior libraries or resources. Transitions will be done with built-in CSS3 animations

## Timeline
1. Day-1 Do basic game logic
2. Day-2 implement score tracking
3. Day-3 styling and Animation
